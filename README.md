# üìö WordFinder

## üèõÔ∏è Current State
This repository has been created to make analysis about lyrics of songs, the goal is to provide tool which will be able to:

- ‚úîÔ∏è   REST API for searching songs by artist and filtering out banned words
- ‚úîÔ∏è   Search <span style="color:green">**600 songs** from **Eminem</span> in <span style="color:green">9 seconds**</span>. on Ryzen 7 5800X and 500MB/s isp
- ‚úîÔ∏è   Find all songs by artist without banned words, could be used to find "family friendly" music without some kind of words
- ‚úîÔ∏è   Provide list of keywords in many ways in ex. these keywords are going to be used as arguments
  
- ‚ùå Find occurrence of specific words and calculate in which songs the word were most used. 
- ‚ùå Database
- ‚ùå Better way of managing banned words sets (There will be endpoint for registering keywords sets, then it will be accessible by id as filter)
## üöÄ Future plans
- Swagger
- Make better errors logging - including sentry
- Caching in PostgresSQL and / or Redis
- Create API Clients (frontend or cli-client)
- Performance monitoring using Grafana

## üî® Build & Run
CLI version:
```bash
make cli
```

API version:
```bash
make api
```

<br><br>
<span style="color:red">**IMPORTANT**</span> For both of these binaries you will need to prepare `.env` file with credentials

```bash
touch .env
```

    "songs": [
      {
        "title": "Example",
        "url": "https://genius.com/example"
      },
      {
        "title": "Example1",
        "url": "https://genius.com/example-1"
      }
    ]
  },
  "error": null
}
```

### GET https://localhost:8080/artists/:the_artist_name/songs/words
`word_count` contains all words used in lyrics which are longer than 2 characters.
```json5
{
  "data": {
    "songs": [
      {
        "title": "Example",
        "url": "https://genius.com/example",
        "words_count": {
          "abc": 2,
          "cba": 1
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Example1",
        "url": "https://genius.com/example-1",
        "words_count": {
          "qwe": 2,
          "rrr": 1,
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "error": null
}
```


### GET https://localhost:8080/artists/:the_artist_name/songs/words?banned_words=:base64
This example shows how songs can be filtered out because of containing one of banned words

`word_count` contains all words used in lyrics which are longer than 2 characters.

`:base64` param in url is base64 string with banned words separated by commas, 


example url: `GET` https://localhost:8080/artists/eminem/songs/words?banned_words=d29yZCx3b3JkMix3b3JkMw
Will return eminem songs without base64 encoded words in lyrics
```json5
{
  "data": {
    "songs": [
      {
        "title": "Example",
        "url": "https://genius.com/example",
        "words_count": {
          "abc": 2,
          "cba": 1
